# CHM491A-UNDER-GRADUATE-PROJECT-III
Reproduced the results of the research paper ”Optimal control of quantum thermal machines using machine learning”


*Implemented a custom script for the Adam optimizer and implemented a custom cost function tailored to the speciﬁc problem domain


*Calculated gradients using Reverse Auto-Diﬀerentiation algorithm to optimize the neural network parameters. This was done using 
torch.autograd package.


*Utilized data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib to create clear and informative graphical representations of the research outcomes
